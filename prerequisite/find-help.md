## Find Help

To find help in vim, type the command `:help`.

By default it takes you to a help document with the most common questions:Â how to navigate, close windows, and quit vim.

It also illustrates how to find help on a specific topic. For example, we can type `:help x` to learn what the key `x` does in normal mode.

We can even get help on the help command itself with `:help help`. In this doc, we see that the help command can be abbreviated to `:h`.

Find the help needed to quit Vim (`:help quit`), write files (`:help write`), read files (`:read`), and everything else.

We can even find the help we need to close this help window with `:help close`.
