## Open files with the Edit Command

Open a files in vim by typing `:edit` in normal mode.

This is a common command and can be abbreviated `:e`.

Type a space and hit `<tab>`.

This will bring up a mini file explorer that, relative to the directory you opened Vim from.

Use `<tab>` and `<shift><tab>` to cycle forward and background, thru the files in current directory.

The left and right arrow keys do the same.

The up arrow takes you up a directory.

And down arrow move into the directory under the cursor.

Hit `<enter>` to open that file under the cursor
